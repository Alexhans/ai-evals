      "output": "The website evaluates tools using a methodology that involves defining specific criteria (e.g., deterministic tests, caching, tool call validation) and categorizing each tool's capabilities based on testing or documentation. Features are labeled with symbols (Y, y, N, n, P, p, ?) to indicate verification status: 'Y' for tested and works, 'y' for documented but unverified, 'N' for not supported, 'n' for documented but unverified, 'P' for partial support, and '?' for unknown. The evaluation also considers open-source status, self-hosting, and language compatibility. The methodology emphasizes transparency, with feedback encouraged to refine the comparisons.",

      "output": "The website explains the value of AI evals to different audiences through tailored explanations on its homepage. For software engineers, it emphasizes control, fast development, and preventing regressions. Product managers are highlighted with benefits like cutting through hype and using proof. Scientists (both coding and non-coding) are addressed by focusing on evaluation methods relevant to their workflows. Non-technical founders receive explanations centered on strategic control and validation. The core message across all audiences is that evals provide structured validation, enabling reliable progress and reducing uncertainty.",
